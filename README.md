# Macroeconomic-Trends-Explorer

### Purpose:
The project aims to explore and visualize key macroeconomic indicators over time to help users understand economic trends and their impact.

### Questions to address:
1.	How has GDP growth varied across different countries or regions over the past few decades?
2.	What are the trends in inflation rates for various countries?
3.	How do certain factors (e.g., education, depletion of resources, labor demand) correlate with GDP growth?

### Data:
•	https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators

### Shiny App:

1.	**GDP Growth Visualization**:
   
•	Interactive map showing GDP growth rates over time

•	Users can track the changes in GDP growth rate throughout the years (2000-2022) via toggle slider widget

•	Different levels of growth rate would be differentiated and displayed on the map using colors of different intensity

2.	**Inflation Trends Dashboard**:
   
•	Interactive filters and selection to analyze a specific country within a given time period (2000-2022).

•	Inflation rate table that presents inflation rate for the selected country and users can sort the table in ascending and descending order

•	An interactive line chart that illustrates the inflation trends over time for the chosen country. Users can zoom in and out, hover over the data points for detailed information

•	The dashboard offers summary statistics for the selected data including mean, median, minimum and maximum inflation rates

3.	**Potential GDP Predictors**:
   
•	Three line charts showing the relationship between GDP growth with 3 other variables (education, depletion of resources, labor demand) that affect GDP from 2002 - 2022

•	Users can choose countries/regions through a drop down menu and variable to focus on through radio buttons

•	Display box showing interpretation of correlation (eg. strong, moderate, weak) of GDP and each variable chosen
